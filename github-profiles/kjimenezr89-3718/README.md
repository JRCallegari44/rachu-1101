# I'm Kevin Jimenez

## Systems Engineer from Per√∫
I work as a **Coordinator** in a Digital Factory on my country. I like to program in my free times, my favorite techonologies are Containers, Javascript, Java, MongoDB and MariaDB, but I would like to learn about Go, Python, Kubernets, Devops, DevSecops and IA.

I am currently pursuing a master's degree in Direction of Technologies Information in ESAN University, it's difficult but fun and very interesting.

## The 5 commands that I use the most
| Command | Description               |
|---------|---------------------------|
| ls      | List current directory    |
| cd      | Change directory          |
| clear   | Clean terminal            |
| mkdir   | Create a directory        |
| sudo    | Run the command as admin. |
